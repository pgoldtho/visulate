Julie Couch formulated Visulate to provide concept design with visualisation
and rendering support to architects, landscape gardeners and interior designers.

Unlike many other visualisation services, Visulate's focus is artistic,
non-photo realistic representations of design proposals.
Visulate specialises in the effective communication of concepts and ideas through
artistic interior and exterior renderings for client presentation,
mood boards and promotional literature.
