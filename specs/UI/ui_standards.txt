1.  Menu Standards

1.1 System should present a 3 level menu with tabs, sub tabs and menu items.
1.2 Menus should be presented as unordered lists <UL> and formatted using css.
1.3 Each menu should be contained in a <div> element and identified with the following id's:

*  l1_tab    = 1st level tabs menu
*  l2_subtab = 2nd level sub tabs menu
*  l3_menu   = 3rd level menu

Note the screen mockup currently names these: navigation, navcontainer and nav.
a new css file called menu.css should be created to implement the new names.


1.4 Active menu selections should be identified by setting their class to "active"

example:

<div id="l1_tab">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#" class="active">Property</a></li>
    <li><a href="2-1.html">Tenant</a></li>
    <li><a href="3-1.html">Payment</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
