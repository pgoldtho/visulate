    The City of Melbourne is located on east central Florida&#39;s Space Coast.
Melbourne is about an hour&#39;s drive south of the Kennedy Space center, and 1-1/2 hours due east of Disney World.  The City is in
the southern portion of Brevard County.  Interstate-95 runs through the county from north-to-south.  Access roads from the west
include the Beach line Expressway (formerly the Beeline) and US.  192, which runs through Melbourne to the beaches.</p>
<p>While most of Melbourne is located on the Florida mainland, a small portion is located on a barrier island.  The Indian River Lagoon
separates the mainland from the island.  The island is a narrow strip of land that separates the Lagoon from the Atlantic
Ocean.  Spanning the Indian River Lagoon to connect the mainland to the barrier island are a pair of four-lane, high-rise
bridges -- the Melbourne Causeway and the Eau Gallie Causeway.</p>
<p>The City is approximately 41 square miles in size,
with about 75% of that land in use.  The City of Melbourne population was 78,427 as of April 1, 2010, according to the University of
Florida Bureau of Economic and Business Research.  The population of Melbourne continues to grow at a modest rate.  Melbourne is
located at the center of a much larger urban area, the <a

v_desc := '<h3>Brevard County Real Estate - Titusville</h3>
<p>Titusville  is the County Seat of Brevard County.  Nicknamed Space City, USA,
It is a principal city of the Palm Bay -Melbourne - Titusville Metropolitan Statistical Area</p>
<p>Titusville is a full
service city covering 30.3 square miles and a population of approximately 45,000.  Titusville is located on the west shore of the
Indian River Lagoon, directly across from the John F.  Kennedy Space Center.  The Atlantic Ocean lies approximately 12 miles to the
east and East Orlando 30 miles to the west.  Incorporated in 1886, Titusville has seen most of its growth since 1962,
with  the creation of the Lunar Landing program at the Space Center.  Titusville is the eastern anchor of Florida&rsquo;s high
tech corridor.  Industrial parks and   prime commercial properties are near major highways such as I-95, SR 528/Beach line
Expressway, and SR 50, all providing easy access to Orlando and other major cities.</p>
<p>Connecting the city to the rest of
Florida and beyond is a modern, uncongested system of road and rail connections.  Interstate 95, US 1,State Road 50 and the Florida
East Coast Railway are all excellent methods for land transportation in the immediate area.</p>
<p>
Commercial air transportation is provided by Orlando International Airport.  General aviation facilities are available at Space Coast Regional
Airport, located just five minutes from Kennedy Space Center and home to 1,200 acres of industrial property.</p>
<p>
    On the Atlantic Ocean sits Port Canaveral, a major deepwater port serving cargo, tanker and cruise markets.  Port Canaveral has shown
tremendous growth of late, registering 3.6 million short tons of cargo and 4.3 million total cruise passengers in FY 2007.
<p>
The nostalgic historic Downtown  area offers arts and crafts shops, clothing and consignment shops, flower and gift shops and a
nearby riverside park, as well as several popular restaurants.</p>
<p>
    Nearby are other gift, hobby, museum and antique
shops.  Within one mile of downtown is the Titusville Municipal Marina with a ships store, a large seawall for viewing manatee and
other marine life.</p>
<p>
    There 10 hotels/motels in Titusville mostly clustered around I95 or the Indian River.</p>
<p>
House prices and rent in Titusville have been negatively impacted by the imminent closure of the shuttle program and the
consequential loss of high salary jobs.  As a real estate investor house prices are softer here than other areas in Brevard County.
It is extremely important that the price paid enables the property to cash flow as a rental as selling prices are unlikely to
rebound in the near future.</p>
