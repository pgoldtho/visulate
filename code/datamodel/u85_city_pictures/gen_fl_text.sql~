<h3>Florida</h3>
<p>
Florida is the fourth largest state in the country in terms of both population and GDP.&nbsp; If Florida was a country, it would be in the top twenty of the world.&nbsp; Florida&rsquo;s economy is larger than Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s or the combined economies of Argentina and Peru. Florida has a lot more to offer than most people are aware of and is a worthy spot for tourists, homeowners, and investors alike. With a record 89.3 million visitors in 2012, Florida is the most popular travel destination in the world. This makes tourism Florida&rsquo;s largest industry, contributing 57 billion dollars to the state&rsquo;s economy annually.</p>
<p>
The most popular cities for tourists are Orlando, Miami, Key West, and Daytona Beach. Florida&rsquo;s second largest industry is agriculture, contributing more than 100 billion dollars to the state&rsquo;s economy. Florida leads the southeast in farm income. Florida produces 75% of US oranges and contributes 40% of the world&rsquo;s orange juice supply. Florida is also the largest producer in the country for other citrus products, sweet corn, and green beans. Florida also largely produces tomatoes, strawberries, sugar cane, cattle, and numerous other crops. The top counties for agriculture production in the state are Palm Beach, Miami Dade, Hillsborough, and Hendry.</p>
<p>
Another major component of the economy is the space industry. The Kennedy Space Center is located in Brevard County and helps provide the 33,000 jobs and 4.1 billion dollars that the space industry provides the economy. Florida ranks 4<sup>th</sup> among states in aerospace employment. International trade is another large component of Florida&rsquo;s economy. 40% of all exports and imports to Latin and South America pass through Florida. Over the last ten years, the total value of Florida&rsquo;s merchandise trade has reached 162 billion dollars in value, a 135% increase. Florida ranks 6th in the U.S. in 2012 in exporting goods produced or with significant value added in the state.</p>
<p>
Real estate is another worthy asset of the Florida economy. Florida&rsquo;s real estate industry is driven by inward migration.&nbsp; It grows because people in other parts of the world want to live in Florida. &nbsp;Florida real estate was hit hard by the recession, but the economy is slowly turning around, and the real estate market will follow. &nbsp;As a result of retiring baby boomers, in 2013 more people moved to Florida than 2008, 2009, and 2010 combined. The population increased 2.7% in Florida from 2010 to 2012, compared to a 1.7% increase for the entire country. Inward migration is increasing demand for properties, and property prices are likely to reflect this.</p>
<p>
The Bergstrom Center for Real Estate Studies at The University of Florida provides a survey of real estate market conditions and provides the following analysis:&nbsp;<a href="http://warrington.ufl.edu/centers/cres/survey.asp">http://warrington.ufl.edu/centers/cres/survey.asp</a></p>';

'<h2>
Florida Regions</h2>
<p>
Florida can be divided into 8 distinct regions: &nbsp;
<img src="/images/Regional-Navigation-Map.jpg" /></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/rental/visulate_search.php?REPORT_CODE=CITY&state=FL&region_id=1">Southeast Florida</a> contains Indian River, St. Lucie, Martin, Palm Beach, Broward, Dade, and Monroe counties. &nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="/rental/visulate_search.php?REPORT_CODE=CITY&state=FL&region_id=2">The Tampa Bay region</a> is home to Citrus, Hernando, Pasco, Hillsborough, Pinellas, Polk, Manatee, and Sarasota counties. &nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="/rental/visulate_search.php?REPORT_CODE=CITY&state=FL&region_id=3">East Central Florida</a> is home to Brevard, Osceola, Orange, Seminole, Lake, Volusia, and Sumter counties. &nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="/rental/visulate_search.php?REPORT_CODE=CITY&state=FL&region_id=4">The Northeastern region</a> of Florida includes Baker, Clay, Duval, Nassau, Putnam, Saint Johns, and Flagler counties. &nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="/rental/visulate_search.php?REPORT_CODE=CITY&state=FL&region_id=5">The Northwest region</a> of Florida borders the Gulf of Mexico and runs from Pensacola to Tallahassee. It includes Escambia, Santa Rosa, Okaloosa, Walton, Holmes, Jackson, Washington, Bay, Calhoun, Liberty, Gulf, Franklin, Gadsden, Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla Counties. &nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="/rental/visulate_search.php?REPORT_CODE=CITY&state=FL&region_id=6">Southwest Florida</a> consists of Charlotte, Lee, and Collier counties.</li>
<li><a href="/rental/visulate_search.php?REPORT_CODE=CITY&state=FL&region_id=7">North Central Florida</a> includes Madison, Hamilton, Taylor, Suwannee, Union, Bradford, Lafayette, Dixie, Levy, Gilchrist, Alachua, Marion and Columbia counties</li>
<li><a href="/rental/visulate_search.php?REPORT_CODE=CITY&state=FL&region_id=8">South Central Florida</a> includes Hardee, Highlands, Okeechobee, DeSoto, Glades, and Hendry counties.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following table shows the population, economic activity, population growth, mean household income, number of housing units, and median home value among the different regions. These numbers come from the United States Census Bureau.</p>
<p>Population describes all persons who are "usually resident" in a specified geographic area. Economic activity is a sum of the region''s manufacturer shipments, merchant wholesaler sales, retail sales, and accommodation and food sales. This number gives an idea of the size of the economy and a basis for comparison. The population growth value shows the difference between the 2012 population estimate and the 2010 population estimate. This number can be used to determine how many people are moving in or out of an area and therefore what the future demand for real estate may be. </p>
<p>Median household income includes the income of the householder and all other individuals over 15 years old in the household. This figure represents the average income of residents and gives insight to the amount of wealth in an area. The "housing units" includes houses, apartments, mobile homes, group of rooms, or single room that is occupied as separate living quarters. Median home value shows the average value of residential properties. This figure, again, provides insight to the wealth of the residents.</p>';

<h3>Sebastian-Vero Beach</h3>
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/visulate.cities/704x440/sebastian_inlet-6.jpg"   title="Sebastian Inlet"  style="border: 1px solid #949494;"/>
<p>
Sebastian-Vero Beach is contained within Indian River County, home to over 135,000 people and one of the wealthiest counties in the nation.<p>
<p>
This region makes up the northern portion of the Treasure Coast, so named because a Spanish treasure fleet wrecked off the coast in 1715. Occasionally, valuables lost in that destructive event wash up on the Florida shore.</p>

<h4>Sebastian</h4>
<p>
The City of Sebastian is home to about 22,000 people. Its economy is driven by tourism and healthcare. Velocity Aircraft is headquartered at the Sebastian Airport.</p>
<p>Nearby Pelican Island National Island Refuge was the first national wildlife refuge in the nation.  Sebastian is home to a campus of Indian River State College.</p>

<h3>Port St. Lucie MSA</h3>
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/visulate.cities/704x440/port_saint_lucie-1.jpg"   title="Port Saint Lucie Civic Center"  style="border: 1px solid #949494;"/>
<p>
The Port St. Lucie MSA covers St. Lucie and Martin Counties. The region has a population in excess of 400,000 people. This makes up the southern portion of the Treasure Coast, though it is sometimes referred to as the Research Coast because of the concentration of biological research firms.</p>

<h4>Port St. Lucie</h4>
<p>
Port St. Lucie was developed as a planned community in the 1960s. As late as the 1950s the area was sparsely inhabited. The residents of that first community refused to incorporate, though the developer included future building projects in the city.</p>
<p> The 2010 Census found that the City of Port St. Lucie is home for over 160,000, a number almost double that of the 2000 Census. Port St. Lucie is the ninth-largest city in Florida.</p>
<p>
The city''s economy is largely driven by the services, especially tourism and healthcare, however, the city is positioning itself as a player in life science research. The Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies opened a LEED-certified research center in 2008 and the Mann Research Center is a 150-acre research park.</p>
<p>The city boasts three PGA tour golf courses that are available for use by the public. The New York Mets hold their spring training at Tradition Field.
The city hosts a campus of Indian River State College.</p>

<h4>Fort Pierce</h4>
<p>
Formerly the principal city of the Port St. Lucie MSA, Fort Pierce has a population over 40,000. West Palm Beach-Fort Pierce is the 38th-largest television market in the nation.</p>
<p>
Established in 1901, Fort Pierce is the county seat of St. Lucie County. It is named for a Second Seminole War-era fort established by Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin K. Pierce. During World War II the navy established a base on the beach and trained the first Underwater Demolition Teams, or frogmen, the predecessors to the Navy SEALs. Today, Fort Pierce is home to the National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum.</p>
<p>
The city''s economy is primarily in the service sectors, including tourism, education, and healthcare.
Fort Pierce is located near the Indian River Lagoon, the estuary with the most biological diversity in the nation. Because of this, the city hosts the Smithsonian Marine Station and Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution of Florida Atlantic University.
The city contains the main campus of Indian River State College.</p>

<h3>Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach MSA</h3>
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/visulate.cities/704x440/miami-7.jpg"   title="Miami, Florida"  style="border: 1px solid #949494;"/>
<p>
The second-longest MSA in the US, Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach includes Miami-Dade, Broward, and coastal Palm Beach Counties. The MSA is the most populous in Florida and the eighth most-populous in the country. The urbanized areas are confined to a strip of land located between the Everglades and the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>
Miami-Fort Lauderdale is the sixteenth-largest television market in the nation.</p>

<h4>Miami</h4>
<p>
The City of Miami has the distinction of being the only major U.S. city to have been founded by a woman. Julia Tuttle, a widow who moved from Cleveland after her husband''s death, convinced oil and railroad tycoon Henry Flagler to extend his railroad from Palm Beach. The railroad was completed in 1896, and Miami was founded the same year.</p>
<p>
Miami experienced decades of booming population, especially after World War II, when soldiers who were stationed and trained on Miami Beach got "sand in their shoes" and moved to get away from cold temperatures up north. </p>
<p>
The most important event in Miami''s history did not even happen in the U.S. Fidel Castro''s 1959 revolution in Cuba prompted large numbers of Cubans to flee the island for exile in Miami. This population paved the way for successive waves of immigrants from Latin America and the Caribbean. With a population that is over 60% Hispanic, Miami is sometimes referred to as the "Capital of Latin America".</p>
<p>
Miami is a growing city populated by over 400,000 people. A majority of those people speak Spanish as their first language. Over half of residents were born outside the U.S. Miami is the seat of Miami-Dade County, which is home for about 2.5 million people. Miami-Dade is the most-populous county in Florida and the seventh-most-populous in the U.S.</p>
<p>
Miami''s economy is primarily based on services, including tourism and healthcare, though many companies have chosen to locate in Miami or started there. Numerous companies are headquartered in Greater Miami, including Burger King, Carnival Cruise Lines, Telemundo, Univision, Perry Ellis International, Bacardi, and world-famous architectural firm Arquitectonica. Numerous U.S. and foreign concerns base their Latin American headquarters in Miami to take advantage of the well-educated Spanish-speaking population, including Sony, Microsoft, American Airlines, Wal-Mart, and Disney. In addition, some Latin American companies headquarter their U.S. divisions in the city, such as Odebrecht Construction, a Brazilian firm. The Brickell neighborhood contains the highest concentration of international banks in the nation.</p>
<p>
Miami is classified by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network as an Alpha- world-class city. Terremark (a subsidiary of Verizon) operates Network Access Point of the Americas, an important data center and Internet exchange point for routing traffic to and from Latin America, in downtown Miami. Another exchange point, the AMPATH network, is in Miami, but it is dedicated to research and education in Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>
PortMiami is the busiest in the world for cruise and passenger traffic, having handled four million cruise passengers in 2013. It is also an important port for cargo, with over half of that cargo coming in from Latin America and the Caribbean. Miami International Airport is the nation''s busiest airport for international cargo and one of the most trafficked for foreign visitors. Four general aviation airports elsewhere in the county handle private aircraft and pilot training.</p>
<p>
Miami is home to Florida International University; while the University of Miami, Barry University, St. Thomas University, Florida Memorial University, and campuses of Johnson & Wales University and Nova Southeastern University are located in the suburbs. Miami Dade College, with campuses across the county, is the second-largest institution of higher learning in the nation by enrollment.</p>

<h4>Fort Lauderdale</h4>
<p>
Named for Major William Lauderdale, who ordered a fort built on the New River during the Second Seminole War in the 1830s, Fort Lauderdale was largely uninhabited until the 20th century. The arrival of the railroad in 1896 changed all that. During World War II, the disappearance of Flight 19 from Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale revived the Bermuda Triangle myth. The city became a major Spring Break destination in the 1950s, which was only compounded by the celebration of the phenomenon in the film Where the Boys Are. The city aggressively pushed out Spring Breakers in the 1980s and created a cultural district downtown in the 2000s.</p>
<p>
Known as "Venice of America" for its numerous inland waterways, Fort Lauderdale is home for over 165,000 people, making it the eighth-largest city in Florida. Broward County, of which Fort Lauderdale is the seat, has over 1.5 million inhabitants, the second-most-populous county in the state.</p>
<p>
The largest segment of Fort Lauderdale''s economy is tourism. Almost a third of visitors attend a convention at the Broward County Convention Center. Many tourists come from the LGBT community because Fort Lauderdale and the adjacent City of Wilton Manors are gay-friendly with large numbers of LGBT people and businesses that cater to that population. </p>
<p>
The city is also a major center for cruise travel. Port Everglades serves the third-most cruise passengers annually of any port in the nation. The port is also an important hub for container cargo and petroleum. The city''s coastal location allows for other maritime recreation, including yachting. This had led to the presence of a large maritime manufacturing and repair industry.</p>
<p>
Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport is ranked number twenty-one nationwide for the number of passengers. The Florida Department of Transportation estimates the airport''s economic impact around $10.6 billion.</p>
<p>
Though the institution has campuses throughout the county, Broward College''s administrative offices are at the Willis Holcombe Center in downtown Fort Lauderdale. The city hosts City College and the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale in addition to satellite campuses of Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University. Nova Southeastern University is located in the suburbs.</p>

<h4>Pompano Beach</h4>
<p>
The city of Pompano Beach was founded by two railroad workers who were conducting a survey for the Florida East Coast Railway expansion to Miami. Local legend has it that the name comes from a local fish that an early settler liked. The city is in northern Broward county and is home to about 100,000 people.</p>
<p>
Pompano''s economy is primarily driven by tourism, though manufacturing and healthcare are also strong. Pompano Beach''s manufacturing centers are primarily devoted to the construction industry. The largest employer in the city is Pompano Park, a horse racing track to which a casino, The Isle, was added.</p>
<p>
The headquarters of the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority, the organization that runs the Tri-Rail light commuter rail, is located in Pompano Beach.
The North Campus of Broward College is located in the adjacent city of Coconut Creek.</p>

<h4>West Palm Beach</h4>
<p>
The City of West Palm Beach was incorporated in 1894. It was founded by Henry Flagler, who extended his railroad line to Lake Worth and built a pair of luxury hotels on Palm Beach. West Palm was created as the home for the hotel workers. It became the seat of Palm Beach County upon its creation in 1909. Like the rest of South Florida, West Palm experienced rapid population growth after World War II.</p>
<p>
Around 100,000 people call West Palm Beach home. West Palm Beach-Fort Pierce is the 38th-largest television market in the nation.</p>
<p>
Its primary economic driver is tourism, though the healthcare industry is very strong. The city also has a strong manufacturing base, especially with respect to the construction industry.
West Palm Beach hosts Palm Beach Atlantic University and a campus of Northwood University.</p>

<h4>Boca Raton</h4>
<p>
Boca Raton is a city of over 80,000 in southern Palm Beach County. Boca is famous as the birthplace of the IBM personal computer. Since 1970, IBM owned and operated a research and manufacturing complex in the city, and it was the team that was based there that developed and assembled the first PCs IBM sold in the early 1980s. IBM moved their PC operations to North Carolina, but their former facility is now a research and business park.</p>
<p>
Tourism is important to Boca Raton''s economy, but white-collar jobs also make up a substantial piece of the pie. Office Depot''s corporate offices are in the city, as is the headquarters for GEO Group (formerly known as Wackenhut), among others. Boca''s reputation as a retirement destination means that healthcare is also an important economic motivator.</p>
<p>
Boca Raton is an affluent city with a median income well above the national median. The city has strict codes to enforce a clean look across the city. Signs are heavily restricted and billboards are not allowed, for instance.</p>
<p>
The main campus of Florida Atlantic University is located in Boca Raton. Lynn University is also in the city, as is a campus of Palm Beach State College.</p>

<h4>Tampa</h4>
<p>Despite its advantageous geography, the City of Tampa struggled initially due to Indian raids and yellow fever. Tampa boomed after phosphates were discovered nearby in the mid-1880s and Henry Plant extended his rail line down to the city. The relocation of some cigar factories by Vicente Martinez Ybor further fueled the city''s growth. Today, the Ybor City District boasts many historic structures and is itself a National Historic Landmark.</p>
<p>Tampa has a population in excess of 330,000. Its has a diverse economy and is home to a number of businesses, including Kforce, SYKES, and Bloomin'' Brands (operator of restaurant chains including Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba''s Italian Grill, and Bonefish Grill). Like many places in Florida, Tampa boasts a robust tourist economy, but many residents are also employed in white collar/administrative positions and health care.</p>
<p>Located just outside of the city is MacDill Air Force Base. MacDill hosts both the U.S. Central Command and Special Operations Command. It is also the location from which so-called "Hurricane Hunter" aircraft are based out of. The base directly employs over 14,000 and contributes an estimated $5 billion to the economy of the Tampa Bay area.</p>
<p>Tampa is served by the Port of Tampa Bay, which handles the most cargo of any port in the state. It specializes in bulk cargo, especially steel and phosphates. It is also a busy cruise ship port, seeing almost a million passengers annually.</p>
<p>All Property Management ranked Tampa as the second-best city in the U.S. for investing in rental properties in 2014.</p>
<p>The Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranks Tampa as a Gamma+ level world city.</p>
<p>Tampa hosts the University of South Florida, University of Tampa, and Hillsborough Community College.</p>

<h4>St. Petersburg</h4>
<p>The City of St. Petersburg is across Tampa Bay from the City of Tampa, on a peninsula that is bound by the bay and the Gulf of Mexico. The city holds the distinction of hosting the first commercial airline with regularly-scheduled flights, which went across the bay to Tampa twice a day beginning on January 1, 1914. The 1924 completion of the Gandy Bridge negated the need for the airline and cut the distance drivers had to travel by half.</p>
<p>St. Pete, home to just shy of a quarter-of-a-million people, is the largest city in Florida that is not its county''s seat. It hosts many businesses, including Raymond James Financial, Home Shopping Network (HSN), and Jabil Circuit. The city''s economy is strong in administrative and white collar jobs, as well as high-tech manufacturing, in addition to tourism and healthcare.</p>
<p>The city is home to the University of South Florida St. Petersburg, Eckerd College, St. Petersburg College, and a campus of Webster University.</p>

<h4>Clearwater</h4>
<p>The seat of Pinellas County, Clearwater is home to over 100,000 people. Pinellas broke away from Hillsborough County in 1912, citing neglect from the county government and difficulty traveling to Tampa.</p>
<p>Like the other cities of the region, Clearwater''s economy is strongly supported by white collar and administrative positions, though tourism and healthcare are also important economic engines. Tech Data, a Fortune 500 company, is one of the businesses headquartered in Clearwater.</p>
<p>The city hosts a campus of St. Petersburg College and the Clearwater Christian College.</p>

<h3>Lakeland-Winter Haven MSA</h3>
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/visulate.cities/704x440/lakeland-1.jpg" title="Tampa, Florida"  style="border: 1px solid #949494;"/>
<p>Polk County lies at the center of the state of Florida. Indeed, a study by the University of Florida shows that Polk County has been the center-point of Florida''s population since 1960. The county is growing because of its location along the I-4 Corridor between Tampa and Orlando. Today, Polk County is home to over 600,000 people. Lakeland/Winter Haven is the 94th largest radio market in the U.S.</p>
<p>Warner University is located in the small city of Lake Wales and Webber International University is nearby in unincorporated Polk County.</p>

<h4>Lakeland</h4>
<p>In 1885, Lakeland incorporated as a city. It had grown due to the extension of the railroad in the area. It has expanded steadily and rapidly, becoming the spring training home of the Detroit Tigers in the 1930s and a flight instruction center during World War II.</p>
<p>The city of about 100,000 has long benefitted from its proximity to phosphate mines and citrus groves. Healthcare and tourism are also strong economic drivers. The headquarters of Publix Supermarkets is located in the city, and the Fortune 500 grocery chain is the city''s largest employer. Saddle Creek Logistics Services is also headquartered in Lakeland.</p>
<p>The city is home to Southeastern University, Florida Southern College, and campuses of Polk State College and Webster University.  It is also home to the newest member of the Florida State University System.  Florida Polytechnic University is strategically located in Lakeland, FL, on the I-4 high-tech corridor and focuses on STEM programs, specifically technology and engineering.</p>

<h4>Winter Haven</h4>
<p>Twenty-five years after Winter Haven incorporated as a city, in 1936, tourist attraction Cypress Gardens opened for business. It was the first theme park in the country and entertained guests with botanical gardens, beautiful women and exhibitions of water sports, especially waterskiing. The completion of the interstate highway system and opening of Walt Disney World in nearby Orlando caused the park to fall on hard times. The gardens were incorporated into Legoland Florida, which opened on the site in 2011.</p>
<p>The first Publix Supermarket opened in Winter Haven in 1930, though the grocery chain''s corporate headquarters are in nearby Lakeland. The economy of the city of over 30,000 is focused on tourism and healthcare.</p>
<p>The main campus of Polk State College is in Winter Haven.</p>

<p>Consisting of Manatee and Sarasota Counties, the Sarasota area is home to over 700,000 residents.</p>
<h4>North Port</h4>
<p>Originally a planned community, North Port Charlotte was incorporated in 1959. The name was shortened to "North Port" in 1974 by popular referendum. The city of over 50,000 is large, containing around seventy-five square miles of territory.</p>
<p>Primarily a bedroom community, North Port''s economy is driven by services including health care and education.</p>
<p>The city hosts the North Port Instructional Site of the University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee.</p>

<h4>Bradenton</h4>
<p>Technically incorporated in 1943, Bradenton is the merger of two cities, Manatee and Bradentown, which were incorporated in 1888 and 1903, respectively. It is the seat of Manatee County and home to around 50,000 people. Bradenton is on the southern shores of Tampa Bay and the Sunshine Skyway bridge connects it to St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>Health care is the primary motivator of Bradenton''s economy, though tourism and other services are also strong. Additionally, the facilities for producing Tropicana juice are in Bradenton. The Bealls department store was founded and is still headquartered in Bradenton (though a chain of stores from Texas with the same name forces them to use the name "Burkes" in many markets).</p>
<p>Higher education opportunities within the city are available at the State College of Florida, Manatee-Sarasota.</p>

<h4>Sarasota</h4>
<p>The origins of the word "Sarasota" are a mystery. "Zara Zote" might refer to Sara, the daughter of Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto, or it might come from a Native American phrase that refers to an easily-spotted landfall. Regardless, the name "Sarasota" was settled on by 1839, after the United States took possession of Florida. Sarasota was incorporated as a town in 1902 and is the seat of Sarasota County.</p>
<p>Two of the Ringling brothers took their circus money and invested some of it in the town, which incorporated as a city the year after they arrived, 1913. The Ringlings brought their "Greatest Show on Earth" to Sarasota in the winter and created developments. Today their estates are historic structures, and their wealth created an institute of higher learning, a museum, and other institutions that give the city a cultural life in excess of what would normally be expected for a city of just over 50,000. Sarasota hosts theaters and operas, an orchestra with the Florida West Coast Symphony, gardens, festivals, and more.</p>
<p>The strongest segment of Sarasota''s economy is health care, though it is also strong in white collar and administrative careers, as well as tourism and other services. Boar''s Head Provision Company is one company that is headquartered in the city.</p>
<p>The University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee is located in the city. New College of Florida occupies a campus that includes the former estate of Edith and Charles Ringling. Sarasota is also home to the Ringling College of Art and Design.</p>

'<h1>East Central Florida</h1>
<img src="http://visulate.com/images/Regional-EastCentral.jpg" alt="East Central Florida" style="float: left;"/>
<p>East Central Florida is home to Brevard, Osceola, Orange, Seminole, Lake, Volusia, and Sumter counties. This region contains some of the state''s most popular tourist destinations including Walt Disney World, Universal Studios, Port Canaveral, and The Kennedy Space Center. This region accounts for a significant number of the state''s technological advancements and has some of the world''s biggest companies including Boeing, Rockwell Collins, Lockheed Martin, and the headquarters of Harris Corporation. The population is approximately 3.4 million people.</p>

<p>There are three Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in East Central Florida:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/rental/visulate_search.php?REPORT_CODE=CITY&state=FL&region_id=3#daytona">Deltona-Daytona Beach-Ormond Beach MSA</a></li>

<h3>Deltona-Daytona Beach-Ormond Beach MSA</h3>
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/visulate.cities/704x440/daytona_beach-4.jpg" alt="Daytona Beach" style="border: 1px solid #949494;"/>
<p>The area is essentially the same as Volusia County, which contains sixteen incorporated municipalities. It is a popular place to retire, though the region has plenty of activity. It is also a tourist destination. The hard-packed sand of Volusia County''s beaches lent itself to auto races beginning in 1903, before paved roads were common, leading to the area''s reputation for cars and racing.</p>
<p>The primary industries are in the service sector, with tourism, healthcare, and education among the most prominent. The region also boasts many small manufacturing centers, which, when added together, make a significant contribution to the county''s economy.</p>
<p>Together with Orlando, the region is the nineteenth-largest television market in the nation.</p>

<h4>Deltona</h4>
<p>Developed in 1962 as a planned retirement community, Deltona is now the largest city in Volusia County, numbering 85,182 residents. Primarily a bedroom community, Deltona is no longer just for retirees. The population is now younger and diverse, with over a quarter of the population being of Hispanic or Latino/a descent. Despite being two counties away, Deltona is only a thirty minute drive from Orlando.</p>
<p>Deltona hosts a campus of Daytona State College.</p>

<h4>Daytona Beach</h4>
<p>Historically an auto-racing mecca due to its geography and climate, Daytona Beach is the location of one of the single most popular sporting events in the country, the NASCAR Daytona 500, which opens the stock car racing season. NASCAR''s main headquarters are in the city. Other auto racing and motorcycle events take place throughout the year. The city is also home to the LPGA and hosts several golf courses.</p>
<p>Daytona Beach, a city of 61,005 people, is additionally served by light manufacturing concerns, especially with respect to the automotive and healthcare industries.</p>
<p>The city is home to Bethune-Cookman University, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona State College, and a campus of the University of Central Florida.</p>

<h4>Ormond Beach</h4>
<p>Known as the "Birthplace of Speed", Ormond Beach was a popular spot for those who liked fast cars after the turn of the 20th century because the hard-packed beach was ideal for going fast. That same beach had led to the development of a tourist resort by Henry Flagler. It later attracted Flagler''s former business partner John D. Rockefeller, who had a winter home in Ormond.</p>
<p>Today, Ormond Beach is home to almost 40,000 people. The largest sectors of the economy lie with retail and healthcare, but trade and manufacturing are important, with science and technology a growing part of the economy.</p>
<p>The Ormond Beach Airport Business Park and Airpark are within a free trade zone.</p>

<h3>Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford MSA</h3>
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/visulate.cities/704x440/orlando-2.jpg" alt="Highway exit sign for Disney World" style="border: 1px solid #949494;"/>
<p>This MSA includes Lake, Orange, Osceola, and Seminole Counties. The urban population of the MSA was 1,510,516 in 2010. There are fourteen cities in Lake County, thirteen in Orange, two in Osceola, and seven in Seminole.</p>
<p>After the Civil War in the 1860s, Greater Orlando was barely-inhabitable wetlands. It took a major drainage project financed by Philadelphia businessman Hamilton Disston in the 1880s to make the land available for settlement. During and after World War II, the U.S. Air Force established several bases and training facilities in the region.</p>
<p>The most important event in the history of Greater Orlando, however, was the construction of the Walt Disney World Resort. Announced in 1965 and opened to the public in 1971, Walt Disney wanted a location with abundant available land that the residents of the east coast could visit. Not only was there ample land in central Florida, but it was inexpensive and the inland location offered some protection from hurricanes. Disney bought up wetlands using dummy corporations so that others would not catch on to his plans. Disney''s 1965 press conference announcing the construction of a new theme park came as a shock to most. Today, the 42,000-acre resort attracts over 50 million people each year. A study conducted at the behest of Disney concluded that the resort and affiliated businesses generated over $18 billion, a number that would be around 2.5% of Florida''s GDP.</p>
<p>The most important economic driver is tourism, though Greater Orlando is also known for high-tech and life science research, military production and training, and processing food that is harvested in the important agricultural regions in rural areas. Minute Maid operates a large juice flavoring plant in Apopka, for example.</p>
<p>Greater Orlando is the third-largest metropolitan area in Florida, the fifth-largest in the southeastern United States, and the 26th largest in the United States. Together with the Deltona-Daytona Beach MSA, Orlando is the nineteenth largest television market in the country.</p>
<p>Greater Orlando is served by the University of Central Florida, whose Orlando campus is the second-largest college campus in the nation by enrollment. The university benefits from its proximity to Kennedy Space Center, where it maintains a campus, enrolling many students in engineering and other fields that support space exploration.</p>

<h4>Orlando</h4>
<p>Orlando incorporated as a city in 1885 due in part to the additional land made available for settlement by Disston''s drainage efforts. In the late 19th century, Orlando was a major hub of citrus production.</p>
<p>Orlando is a major tourist destination, though it is more than just the Walt Disney World Resort. Greater Orlando is home to many amusement parks, including Universal Orlando, whose Islands of Adventure park includes a wildly popular Harry Potter-themed area. Orlando is also one of the largest destinations for conventions in the country.</p>
<p>Aside from tourism, Orlando boasts the seventh-largest research park in the nation, Central Florida Research Park, located next to the University of Central Florida, and is home to a major high-tech industry that includes the Electronic Arts studio that produces the most popular video game in the U.S., Madden NFL football. The region is also an important player in the defense industry, with many manufacturing centers devoted to military production. Additionally, it is an important military training center, counting a number of flight simulators among its offerings.</p>
<p>Orlando''s population of about a quarter-of-a-million is diverse, with over a quarter of residents identifying as Hispanic or Latino/a.</p>

</ul>


<h4>Kissimmee</h4>
<p>The headquarters of Hamilton Disston''s drainage company, Kissimmee boomed in the 1880s. The city was an important regional steamship port, owing that status to its location on Lake Tohopekaliga. The expansion of the railroads eliminated the need for Kissimmee''s steamship industry, forcing the city to rely on agriculture and cattle ranching until Walt Disney World opened in 1971.</p>
<p>Today, Kissimmee''s economy is focused on tourism, education, and construction. The city has around 60,000 residents, over half of which identify as Hispanic or Latino/a. Kissimmee''s proximity to Orlando and the Walt Disney World Resort make it a popular destination for tourists.</p>
<p>The city hosts Johnson University Florida (formerly Johnson Bible College) and a campus of Valencia College.</p>

</ul>

<h4>Sanford</h4>
<p>A port city at the intersection of Lake Monroe and the St. Johns River, Sanford was incorporated in 1877. Envisioned as a transportation center, the city''s founder, Henry S. Sanford, nicknamed it "the Gate City of South Florida". It became a hub for shipping agricultural products, which earned the city another nickname, "Celery City". During World War II, the city grew because of the presence of a naval air station. In 2012, the name "Sanford"received national attention because of the shooting death of Miami teenager Trayvon Martin in the city.</p>
<p>Sanford, a city of over 50,000, still prospers due to its coastal location, but now recreational boating occurs at marinas alongside commercial craft. The Aerosim Flight Academy is located within Orlando Sanford International Airport, the former site of Naval Air Station Sanford. Sanford''s economy is primarily driven by the service sectors and construction.</p>
<p>The main campus of Seminole State College of Florida is located at Sanford.</p>

<h3>Palm Bay-Melbourne-Titusville MSA</h3>
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/visulate.cities/704x440/cape_canaveral-22.jpg" alt="SpaceX Launch from Cape Canaveral" style="border: 1px solid #949494;">

<p>The MSA covers the same territory as Brevard County, a region referred to as the Space Coast because of the presence of the John F. Kennedy Space Center. The center is located at Cape Canaveral and is the location from which NASA and other spacecraft takeoff. According to the 2010 Census, Brevard County is home to over half-a-million people, making it the ninth most populous county in Florida. In 2010 Kiplinger.com rated the county one of the five best places in America to retire.</p>
<p>Brevard County''s economy is primarily based on tourism, though the federal government contributes a great deal because of Kennedy Space Center, which is the largest employer in the region. Other service industries such as healthcare and education are also important contributors to the economy.</p>
<p>Kennedy Space Center is located on Merritt Island, across the intracoastal waterway from Titusville. In the 1940s the US military established a missile testing facility there because the land was largely undeveloped and the agreeable climate allowed for year-round operations. When NASA searched for a long-term base from which to launch spacecraft, they chose Merritt Island for its access to the testing facility and to nearby communities. NASA purchased over 100,000 acres, of which significant portions are managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as a wildlife refuge, most of which are accessible to visitors.</p>
<p>Port Canaveral is a major economic force. It essentially serves as Orlando''s port and is one of the busiest for cruise departures in the state. Disney Cruise Lines operates out of Port Canaveral, as does Carnival and Royal Caribbean. The port is within one of the largest foreign trade zones in the country.</p>
<p>Brevard County was hit particularly hard by the combined effect of the recession and the closing of the shuttle program. In 2012, Brevard had the highest foreclosure rate in the nation. In 2013, the metro area was rated by RealtyTrac as the best in the country for buying because of the low prices.</p>
<p>Eastern Florida State College has four campuses in Brevard County. In addition, the University of Central Florida maintains a satellite campus in Cocoa.</p>

<h4>Palm Bay</h4>
<p>The city of Palm Bay is the largest in Brevard County and is home to over 100,000 people. In 2010, Forbes rated Palm Bay as the 11th-most innovative city in the U.S. The city''s largest employer is Harris Corporation, maker of telecommunications equipment, including materials for satellites. Healthcare and other services are also strong contributors to the economy.</p>

<h4>Melbourne</h4>
<p>Melbourne is an Old Florida city, containing many 19th- and early 20th-century homes. It is located about halfway between Miami and Jacksonville.</p>
<p>76,068 people called Melbourne home in 2010. The city is served by Melbourne International Airport, which is contained within a foreign trade zone. It is also the location of the Florida Institute of Technology. Tourism and healthcare are the most important economic drivers in Melbourne.</p>

<h4>Titusville</h4>
<p>Nicknamed "Space City USA" for its proximity to Kennedy Space Center, Titusville is known as the place to go to in order to see spacecraft launches. The city''s location just across the intracoastal waterway from KSC has given the city a highly-educated workforce and experience with government aerospace contractors.</p>
<p>Titusville is home for just under 50,000 people. The space center is the most important economic engine, both in direct employment and supporting industries including tourism.</p>

South Central Florida includes Hardee, Highlands, Okeechobee, DeSoto, Glades, and Hendry counties. Its central location makes it convenient for many large metropolitan areas. There is a large Hispanic population in this region; 50% of Hendry County&rsquo;s population is Hispanic. This region has a more rural, laidback lifestyle. Agriculture is a big industry in the area. Coca Cola recently spent 2 billion dollars to support the planting of 25,000 acres of orange trees. Lake Okeechobee is located in Okeechobee and is the nation&rsquo;s second largest fresh water lake.</p>
