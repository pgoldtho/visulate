<p>
Cape Canaveral is located on Florida&#39;s Atlantic coast. It is north of Cocoa Beach and east of Merritt Island It is part of a region
known as the Space Coast, and is the site of the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS).  CCAFS is an installation of the
US Air Force Space Command which is headquartered at Patrick Air Force Base in Satellite Beach.  It is the primary launch site for
unmanned rockets in the Eastern United States.</p>
<p>Port Canaveral is a deep water port located within Cape Canaveral.  The port is a base for cruise and cargo shipping.
Disney, Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Lines operate cruise ships from Port Canaveral.  Port Canaveral
operates as  foreign trade zone.   This provides tax and tariff advantages to cargo operations from the port.
A 2010 study conducted by Martin Associates estimated the port generated 13,093 jobs and $648.8 million in economic activity:</p>

http://www.portcanaveral.com/general/news/canaveral_impact_report_51010.pdf</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
The Port Authority has approximately 1.9 million sq ft of commercial and industrial buildings.  There is an additional
700,000 sq ft of industrial space outside the Port Authority.  There are 3 hotels in Cape Canaveral providing a total of
380,000 sq ft of accommodation.   Cape Canaveral has 422,951 sq ft of office space, 125,492 retail and 136,881 shopping.</p>
<p>
There is around 9 million sq ft of residential real estate in Cape Canaveral.  6 million of this is allocated to condominium
units and another 1 million in townhouses.  There are 800,000 sq ft of multi-family units.  Single family homes make up a
relatively small proportion of the residential market. </p>
<p>
Properties in Cape Canaveral are generally considered less desirable than similar properties in Cocoa Beach to the south.
Much of the residential real estate in both cities dates from the 1960&#39;s.  A lot of the cheaper condos are converted multi-family properties.
Typically 1 bed/ 1 bath units with less than 400 sq ft of living space.  Zoning restrictions for most of the city limit the minimum
term of a rental agreement.  These are designed to limit the areas in Cape Canaveral where condos can be used as vacation rentals.</p>

<p>Mims is a good place for those looking to buy a lot of land for a reasonable price, a
lot of bang for your buck so to speak.  With its wide open spaces and wooded trails, it is a particularly ideal place if you want to
keep horses.  Salt Lake Wildlife Management Area has many miles for riding, and the North Brevard Horseman&rsquo;s Club would be
a great place to meet other people with a shared interest of equestrian activities.</p>
<p>
Mims is a semi-rural community in north 
Brevard County, with a population of approximately 7,000 people.  It is 22.4 square miles, 5.3 of which are water. 
Themedian income in 2012 was $35,216, and 15% of the population lived under the poverty line.  Compared to rest of country
Mim&rsquo;s cost of livingis 9.8% less.</p>
<p>
A few sources of employment in Mims include The Kennedy Space Center, Parrish 
Medical Center, and Brevard Community College.  Mims is the closest city in Brevard County to Orlando.  It therefore would be a good
place for those who want to work in Orlando, but have a lower cost of living.</p>
<p>
Mims is not for those who enjoy a busy or fast
paced life style.  It does not have many shopping or restaurant options.  It has a Dollar Store, a Walgreens, and a gas station but
not a lot else.  However, if you do want to spend your free time doing something a little more exciting, it wouldn&rsquo;t take more
than half an hour to get to somewhere with decent restaurants and stores.  It is a quiet town with lots of space and room to
grow.</p>
