<p>
 This is particularly for managers to record agreements and for Owners to see.

First select and click on the property on the left of the screen, click new agreement and enter the details requested -the late fee is automatically recorded into the payment/receivable screen, the grace period is the number of days before the late fee is applied.  Press save, when all the information has been entered

Then click on Add tenant. The tenant will already need to be in the system under the people screen, when you click on the arrow at Tenant name a choice of people will come up. Zero balances must also be recorded. If your tenant is receiving section 8 assistance you can record which office they are with and the amount that section 8 pays
