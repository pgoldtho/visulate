<h1>Property Details</h1>
 
 <img src="images/property.jpg">
<p>
The property screen allows you to record and view details of the properties that
 you own or manage.  The screen lists properties by business unit on the left of 
 the screen.  Click on property name to view its details.  Each property is 
 assigned to a business unit.  Business units provide a way to group properties 
 for management and reporting purposes.  
</p>

<p>
For example, an investor who employs a number of property managers for 
buildings in different locations can create a separate business unit for each 
one.  Visulate uses business units to control the list of properties that a user
 can access.  An investor who owns a number of properties can grant access to 
 more than one manager.  The manager can only access properties in business 
 units where they have been granted access.  Similarly a manager can manage 
 properties for more than one owner and use business units to control the list 
 of properties that the owner can see.
</p>

 <p>
 The property screen is used to create or edit property details.  Press the
 New Property button to enter a new record.  Select a business unit from the
 drop down list and then enter the property's address and purchase details. 
 Items with a red * are mandatory.  The Purchase Price, Land Value and 
 Depreciation Term will be used to calculate a year end depreciation amount
for tax purposes.  The Depreciation Term 	should be 27.5 (years)
 for residential properties and 45 years for commercial units.  Building size
 should be entered in square feet and lot size in acres.  
 </p>
 
 <p>Enter a numeric value in the units field to indicate the number of 
 rentable (sub) units the property contains.  For example, enter 1 for a
 single family home, 2 for a duplex, 3 for a triplex and so on.  Press the
 New Unit button to enter a unique name (Unit 1, 2, 3 etc), size, bedrooms
 and bathrooms for each unit.  
</p>

<p>
The Date sold, Sale Amount and Note fields can be completed when a property is
sold to record transaction details.  Check the Note check box to indicate 
you are carrying a note as a result of the sale.
