<h1>Business Units</h1>
<p>
Visulate allows business owners and owner managers to define business units.  A business unit is a logical collection of properties.  For example, a property management company could create separate business units for each of their owners or real estate investor could create discrete business units based on geographic location (e.g. by city or state).</p>
<p>
Each business unit may contain one or more properties. Users are granted shared access to business units. This allows them to access the details for the properties in the business unit. For example, an owner could create a business unit for all the units they they own in an apartment complex then grant access to the manager who will manage them.  Owners and managers have shared access to business units. Each can login to Visulate to view and update property details based on their role. </p>
<p>
Click on the “create sub unit” link to create a new business unit (if your role allows you to create business units).
