<h1>Tenant Actions</h1>
<p>
This screen is used to record details of any actions that are performed during a tenancy agreement.
It shows a running total of payments owed and paid for the duration of the agreement and allows 
Agreement actions like phone calls and eviction proceedings to be recorded.  Each action may have a
dollar amount associated with it.  Checking the "Recoverable" check box causes this dollar amount to be
added to the list of accounts payable for the tenant.
