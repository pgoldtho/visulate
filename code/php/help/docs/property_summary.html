This screen is for owners and managers

It is a year to date summary giving details on a given property of what has been spent and where it has been spent. It also gives you what has been received and what is owed by the tenants.

If you click on the circle to the right of an item a further breakdown will then appear on the right of the screen. You can then click on any date and it will take you to the screen where the invoice details can be changed and looked at  further.
