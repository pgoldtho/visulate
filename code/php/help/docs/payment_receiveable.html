<p>

The properties and rents payable are loaded automatically onto this the screen. The manager then records when the rent is actually paid for a given month and any late fees as necessary. This information is then relayed back to the tenant screen to keep track of their individual payments.
The current month always appears on the screen but you can scroll back to previous months, and make changes by clicking on red cross to undo a payment or add a new payment that has been made.
When all changes have been made click on save button just above other payments received.

Other payments received is where you would record any mortgage notes or money from tenants that wasn't rent.
