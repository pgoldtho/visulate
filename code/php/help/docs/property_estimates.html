<h1>Property Estimates</h1>
<p>
This worksheet is designed to help evaluate potential real estate investements. It calculates the net operating income (NOI), capitalization rate (CAP Rate) and cash on cash return figures for a property. It also estimates the cost of finance to provide a cash flow summary for the investment.</p>
<p>
Enter the monthly rental income that the property would generate if it was fully rented (i.e. no vacancies). Then estimate the annual income from other sources (e.g. a coin operated laundry or vending machines). The monthly rental income is multiplied by 12 and added to the other income to calculate the potential gross income for the property.</p>
<p>
Next, estimate the running costs for the property. These should include an allowance for vacancies. These will vary depending on the expected use. A figure of 5% is reasonable for residential rental property, a seasonal vacation rental could have a vacancy rate as high as 60 or 80%. Make an allowance for repairs and maintenance. The worksheet allows you to calculate and fund a replacement reserve. Enter the estimated costs for items that typically require replacement at 3,5, and 12 year intervals (e.g. carpet, paint, roof or furnace). The worksheet calculates how much money you have to save each year to fund your replacements. Enter annual values for maintenance, utilities, taxes, insurance and management fees. </p>
<p>
Enter the purchase price, down payment and closing costs then press the calculate button to generate an analysis. Alternatively, leave the purchase price blank and enter a desired CAP rate to calculate an offer price. The cap rate is calculated as the NOI/Purchase Price * 100. Compare the cap rate for your candidate property with the cap rates for comparable properties to determine whether you are paying too much for the property. A cap rate that is equal to or greater than the cap rate for comparable properties in your market is good.</p>
<p>
Cash on cash measures the return on cash invested in property (i.e. the down payment). It shows your effective rate of interest for the cash you are investing in the property.
Finance</p>
<p>
The following tables provide an estimate for the finance costs associated with the figures entered above. The 1st loan amount defaults to the purchase price less down payment. If all closing costs are to be included in the financing, change the loan amount to add the closing costs and enter 0 for the Closing Costs amount in the previous section. The property tax and insurance are copied from the payments entered above. The term of the 1st loan is calculated as a 30 year, fixed rate amortizing loan with an interest rate of 8%. You can modify these values as required. The form will automatically recaluate the monthly total when the values change. </p>
<p>
The final table shows annual and monthly cash flow summaries based on the calculated NOI and loan payments.</p>
